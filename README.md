# Malaria Cell Classification with CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify parasitized and uninfected red blood cells using microscopic images. The model is built with Keras and achieves **~99% accuracy** on the test set with data augmentation.

## Key Features
- Binary classification: `Parasitized` vs. `Uninfected`
- Model: Custom CNN (`cnn_aug_model`)
  - 4 convolutional blocks
  - ReLU activation
  - BatchNormalization and Dropout
- Data Augmentation: rotation, zoom, horizontal flip
- Optimizer: Adam
- Accuracy: **~99%**
